Hardware
========
-You need to implement schematic: schematic.pdf

-Usgin a linear motion mechanism in two axes, each axes moved by a dc motor (24V stronger one for Y and 12V for X)
This can be implemented using old printers mechanisms (two printers). Find pics on this directory

-X axis has a magnet attached

-The entire mechanism is inside a homemade wooden box covered with a cardboard lid

-Robot representation is a paper figure on a magnet

*Take a look inside pictures directory



Firmware
========
Firmware gets commands using SERIAL cominucation with a UART peripheral of uC.

The UART peripheral pins communicates with host pc usgin a USB-UART FT232 chip.

Commands that uC recives is 8 bytes long:

<Axis>:<Direction>:4 digits time (in miliseconds, not accurate)

<x,y>:<f,b>:xxxx

Examples:

x:f:0100   (move in X axis, forward with a 100 milisecods motion)
y:b:0280   (move in Y axis, backward with a 280 milisecods motion)

You can try this by sending the commands directly to hardware with a serial terminal like: microcom, nanocom, picocom.




Firmware Compiling
==================
Hardware firmware is written in C for SDCC compiler and PIC18F4550 microcontroller

For firmware compiling use the Makefile in hdwr direcotry:

$ make

Then write compiler output code.hex in your PIC18F4550 uC
